#Django Poll

This is my first Django project. It follows [the tutorial in the official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/).

## Getting started

1. Set up a virtual environment. Freecode have a [good tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/).
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
